# Face Recognition App

## Overview
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the [Clarifai Face Detection API](https://clarifai.com/models/face-detection-image-recognition-model-a403429f2ddf4b49b307e318f00e528b-detection#documentation)

Face Recognition App was completed as part of 'The Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery' on Udemy.com. This app accepts image URLs, identifies faces in the submitted image, and then places a square around any identified faces.
